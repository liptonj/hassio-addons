# Icon Placeholder

For a complete Home Assistant add-on, you should add an `icon.png` file in this directory.

## Requirements

- **Format**: PNG
- **Size**: 256x256 pixels (recommended)
- **Content**: Should represent ThousandEyes or network monitoring
- **Background**: Transparent or solid color

## Suggestions

1. **Official ThousandEyes Logo**: Contact ThousandEyes for their official logo
2. **Network Monitoring Icon**: Use a generic network/monitoring icon
3. **Custom Design**: Create a custom icon that represents network monitoring

## Where to Find Icons

- ThousandEyes Marketing: Request official brand assets
- [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/) - Search for "network monitoring"
- [Icons8](https://icons8.com/) - Search for "network" or "monitoring"
- Design your own using tools like Figma, Inkscape, or GIMP

## Adding the Icon

Once you have your icon:
1. Save it as `icon.png` in this directory
2. Ensure it's 256x256 pixels
3. Delete this placeholder file (`icon.png.md`)
4. The icon will automatically appear in the Home Assistant Add-on Store

## Note

Without an icon, Home Assistant will show a default placeholder icon for the add-on.
